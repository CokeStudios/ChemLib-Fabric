# ChemLib - Fabric Library
_This is a Fabric port of the original ChemLib Forge library by Dark_Arcana. It adds over 950+ items to Minecraft, including every known chemical element, compound, metal, liquid, and gas that exists in the real world. The purpose of this library is to provide a shared source of items, blocks, and fluids for chemistry and tech mods. It was originally developed for the Alchemistry mod but can be used by any mod!_
